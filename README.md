# Demonstration code for *Biting midge dynamics and bluetongue transmission: A multiscale model linking catch data with climate and disease outbreaks*

We give a script for cleaning and using the relevant E-OBS climate data in /data_conversion and the functions used to calculate:

* Climate dependent midge biting activity
* BTV vectorial capacity, per-midge and per-cattle.
* BTV reproductive ratio for various level of midge biting.
* The proportion of herds expected to have growing BTV epizootics if an infectious animal was introduced on any given day.

We give the relevant functions, supply data for the E-OBS spatial grid square containing the Netherlands trap sites, and a MATLAB live script describing the calculations, given as a step-by-step demonstration. The MATLAB live scipt can be found at `reproductive_ratios/reproductive_ratio_example.mlx`.
